.TH HSH 1 "22 August 2025" "Version 1.0" "Holberton Simple Shell Project - User Manual"


.SH NAME
hsh \- a simple shell interpretation of the standard shell

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Interactive mode: 
\&./hsh [command] [option]
.br
.B Non-Interactive mode: 
[command] [option] | ./hsh
.br
.br
Following execution, the shell will display the prompt "ðŸ’€> " where users can enter commands.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The purpose of the HSH shell is to provide a user interface for interacting with the operating system's kernel. It acts as a command-line interpreter, enabling users to execute commands, manage files and directories, automate tasks through scripting, and perform system administration functions.
Specifically, the HSH shell performs the following key functions:
.br
.br
.B Command Interpretation and Execution:
.br
It reads user-entered commands (in interactive mode), interprets them, and translates them into instructions that the kernel can understand and execute.
.br
.br
.B Input/Output Redirection:
.br
It allows users to redirect the output of a command to a file or another command (using pipes), and to take input from a file instead of the keyboard (non-interactive mode).

.SH OPTIONS
Commands can be entered directly into the command line. Options can be entered after the main command.
The following options are supported:
.br
.br
.B [ -i ]
- Specifies that the shell is interactive.
.br
With the -i option present and the shell's standard input and standard error handling attached to the terminal, the shell is considered to be interactive.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
Environment variables in the HSH shell serve as a mechanism to store and share configuration information and settings that are accessible to the current shell and all its child processes. Their primary purposes include:
.br
.br
.B Configuration and Customisation:
They allow users to customise their shell environment and the behaviour of programs. For example, the PATH variable defines directories where the shell searches for executable commands, and HOME points to the user's home directory.
.br
.br
.B Information Sharing:
The HSH environment variables facilitate the passing of information and settings from parent processes to child processes. This ensures that programs launched from the shell inherit relevant environmental details, such as locale settings,  terminal type and user-specific configurations.
.br
.br
The following are examples of environment variables:
.br
.br
.B PATH
- Directories to search for commands.
.br
.B HOME
- The home directory.
.br
.B USER
- The name of the current user.
.br
.B SHELL
- The absolute path to the user's default shell.
.br
.B TERM
- The type of terminal being used.

.SH BUILTINS
The following builtin commands are supported:
.br
.br
.B exit
- Exit the shell.
.br
.B env
- Prints environment variables from the current environment.
.br
.B clear
- Clears the terminal screen.
.br
.B cd
- Changes the current directory to the given directory.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell will exit with one of the following statuses:
.br
.br
.B 1 - 3
- A specific command could not be executed due to an error.
.br
.B 127
- A specified command could not be found.
