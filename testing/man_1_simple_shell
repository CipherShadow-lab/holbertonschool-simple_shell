.SH NAME
hsh \- a simple shell interpretation of the standard shell

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh 
command [option] [FILE]
.fi

Following execution, the shell will display the prompt "$ " where users can enter commands. 

.SH DESCRIPTION
This project is a simple Unix shell implemented in the C programming language. It replicates a subset of standard shell behaviour, such as executing programs, handling environment variables and responding to user input. 

This simple shell has both interactive and non-interactive modes, where commands can either be entered to the running shell, or through an executed file (see below).

.SH RETURN VALUE
The return value will be the exit status of the command. 

.SH EXAMPLES

.B Example (Interactive mode):
.nf
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($) exit
$
.fi
.br

.B Example (Non-interactive mode):
.br
.nf
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
.fi
